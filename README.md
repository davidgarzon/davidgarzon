## Background

VP of Product & Technology with 15+ years building and scaling SaaS and AI-first platforms across startups, scale-ups and global companies.

Led Product, Engineering, Data and AI organizations from 10 → 65+ professionals.  
Owned end-to-end product strategy, roadmap, AI transformation, and P&L across multi-product environments.

Founder mindset. Operator discipline. Systems thinking.

## What I Actually Do

I don’t ship features.  
I design systems.

- AI-native product strategy (ICP → architecture → GTM loops)
- Multi-agent orchestration & execution layers
- Decision & scoring engines (structured + unstructured signals)
- Platform foundations (multi-tenant, RBAC, event-driven systems)
- AI as infrastructure — not as a UI gimmick

AI is not an add-on.  
It is the execution layer.

## Architecture Principles

- Platform > Feature  
- Decisions > Dashboards  
- Memory-driven systems  
- Tools + Agents + Feedback loops  
- Business impact > Technical novelty  
- Distribution matters as much as architecture

## Product Philosophy

Traditional SaaS:

User → UI → Backend → Database  

AI-native systems:

User → Orchestrator → Agents → Memory → Tools → Execution → Feedback loop  

Intelligence is not an endpoint.  
It is a loop.

AI-native companies are designed around:
- orchestration
- decision layers
- feedback systems
- compounding data advantage

## Tech (when it matters)

Python · FastAPI · OpenAI · LangGraph · Postgres · Vector DBs · GCP · AWS · Terraform

I care more about system design than stacks.

## Writing & Thinking

- AI-native product design  
- AEO / GEO strategy  
- Multi-agent system models  
- AI-driven growth loops  
- Operating systems for product teams
