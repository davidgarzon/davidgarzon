## What I Actually Do

I don’t ship features.  
I design systems.

- Multi-agent AI orchestration (LLM-driven execution layers)
- Decision & scoring engines (structured + unstructured signals)
- SaaS platform blueprints (multi-tenant, RBAC, event-driven)
- AI-native product discovery & prioritization frameworks
- Automation systems across marketing, sales & operations

AI is not an add-on.  
It is the core primitive.

## Current Open Work

🔹 **multi-agent-business-operator**  
Modular framework for orchestrating specialized AI agents with memory and tool registries.

🔹 **digital-presence-score-engine**  
Weighted scoring model transforming digital signals into executable intelligence.

🔹 **saas-platform-blueprint**  
Reference architecture for AI-native SaaS platforms.

🔹 **ai-product-discovery-kit**  
LLM-powered system for structured product discovery and prioritization.

🚧 Work in progress — repositories will progressively become public.

## Product Philosophy

AI is not a feature layer.  
It is the execution layer.

Traditional SaaS:

User → UI → Backend → Database

AI-native SaaS:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User] --> O[Orchestrator]
    O --> A[Agent Registry]
    A --> M[Memory Layer]
    A --> T[Tooling Layer]
    M --> A
    T --> A
    A --> Act[Action / Execution]
```

Intelligence is not an endpoint.  
It is a loop.

AI-native companies are designed around:
- Orchestration
- Memory
- Decision layers
- Autonomous execution cycles

The future is not chatbots.  
It is operational intelligence.

## Writing & Thinking

I explore:
- Multi-agent system design
- AI-native organizational models
- Scoring engines & decision automation
- Platform strategy in the LLM era
