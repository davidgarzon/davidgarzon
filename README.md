## What I Actually Do

I don’t ship features.  
I design systems.

- Multi-agent AI orchestration (LLM-driven execution layers)
- Decision & scoring engines (structured + unstructured signals)
- SaaS platform blueprints (multi-tenant, RBAC, event-driven)
- AI-native product discovery & prioritization frameworks
- Automation systems across marketing, sales & operations

AI is not an add-on. It is the core primitive.

## Stack

Python · FastAPI · LangGraph · OpenAI · GCP · AWS · Terraform · SQL · Vector DBs

## Product Philosophy

Most AI products fail because they treat AI as a feature.

AI-native companies are designed around:
- orchestration
- memory
- decision layers
- autonomous execution loops

The future is not chatbots.  
It’s operational intelligence.

## Writing & Thinking

I explore:
- Multi-agent system design
- AI-native organizational models
- Scoring engines & decision automation
- Platform strategy in the LLM era
